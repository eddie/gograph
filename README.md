# Go Graph

Package for working with Graphs written in Golang, heavily borrowed from The Algorithm Design Manual, Steven S. Skeina.

# Warning

This is a work in progress and not ready for production usage, it was created to help myself learn Golang and is currently being developed. The implementation is probably not the most efficient, but feel free to send pull requests.

# TODO

- Split graph.go into multiple relevant files
- Tests
